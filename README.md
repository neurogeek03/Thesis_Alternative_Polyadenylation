Title: Quantification of Alternative Polyadenylation in RNA-seq datasets over neurodevelopment time 
This project uses 2 methods to identify 3'UTR lengthening or shortening by comparing two timepoints in neuron differentiation (day 30 with day 0). 

Abstract: The role of post transcriptional regulation in neurodevelopment is quite pervasive, activating gene programs that give rise to specialized cell 
features and functions. In this context, 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) play a significant role in regulating mRNA translation, stability, and subcellular 
localization. This is mediated by factors such as miRNAs, lncRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind regions at the 3’UTR. Longer 3’UTRs present 
multiple such regions, leading to complex regulation patterns, while shorter ones are characterized by simpler patterns. The process through which one 
gene can have transcripts with longer or shorter 3’UTRs is known as alternative polyadenylation (APA). This study aims to characterize APA events in an 
RNA-seq dataset of iPSCs differentiating into cortical neurons.
